# bike-share-6040-ec

A short extra credit project from CSE 6040 exploring [Lyft bike share data](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels) from the San Francisco Bay Area.

Since this was built to run in Vocareum, there were some restrictions, including space constraints. The full original dataset was trimmed down to a smaller CSV file.
